    <h3>Quick and Easy Pan Fried Pork Chops</h3>
    <p>A lot of people credit chicken as the most versatile, and easiest kind of meat to cook with. And while it’s true that the white meat tastes delicious in various types of recipes, I would say that you can’t overlook pork chops for its versatility either. This meat cut can be enjoyed in so many…</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pieces pork chops</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Knorr SavorRich Pork Liquid Seasoning</li>
        <li>1 piece egg</li>
        <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>10 tablespoons Panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>2 cups cooking oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Lay the pork chops flat on a large plate. Brush Knorr SavorRich Pork Liquid Seasoning on both sides of each pork chop. Let it stay for at least 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare the basic fried pork chop by heating 4 tablespoons of oil in pan. Once the oil gets hot, pan-fry one piece of marinated pork chop in medium heat for 30 seconds. Adjust the heat to low and continue to fry for 7 to 8 minutes. Turn the pork chop over and so the same step on the opposite side. Remove from the pan. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Start to prepare the flour coated fried pork chop by heating the remaining oil in a pan. Beat a piece of egg in a bowl. Dredge one piece of marinated pork chop in all-purpose flour and then dip in beaten egg. Dredge the pork chop back in flour and then fry one side in medium heat for 6 minutes. Flip and continue to fry the other side for the same amount of time. Remove from the pan and place on a plate lined with paper towel. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Prepare the breaded pork chop by dredging the remaining pork in flour. Dip in beaten egg and then dredge in Panko bread crumbs. Fry in medium heat for 6 minutes per side. Remove from the pan and place on a plate lined with paper towel.</li>
        <li>Arrange all pan-fried pork chops in a large serving plate. Serve! Share and enjoy!</li>
